    <h1 style="color: antiquewhite;">Introduction to 
        Web Development Summer Camp</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In our interconnected and rapidly advancing world,
        <br>digital literacy is an essential skill for everyone, regardless of their field of study or career
        aspirations.
        <br> Recognizing this need, we at the C3 Club have designed an accessible and comprehensive course
        titled "Introduction to Web Development." This program is open to all students, regardless of their majors, and
        is prepared to provide a unique blend of theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in the exciting world
        of web development.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
    <p>Our primary goal is to enable students from diverse disciplines to gain valuable skills and broaden their
        horizons. For Computer Science and Technology (CST/MCST) and Electronic Information Engineering (EIE) or
        Information and Communication Engineering (ICE) students, this course is prepared to provide a solid foundation
        in coding and programming, essential to their respective fields. For students pursuing Business Administration
        (BBA) and Master of Business Administration (MBA), the course will offer insight into website design and a
        glimpse into the future of digital business.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Our Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To introduce participants to the fundamentals of web development.</li>
        <li>To provide CST/MCST and EIE/ICE students with practical coding and programming skills.</li>
        <li>To give BBA and MBA students a working knowledge of website design and the role of digital platforms in
            contemporary business.</li>
        <li>To foster cross-disciplinary communication and cooperation among students.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Acquired basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the building blocks of web development.</li>
        <li>Gained hands-on experience in building and deploying a complete website.</li>
        <li>Understand the crucial role of digital technologies in diverse fields (in technology and business).</li>
        <li>Developed a broader perspective by working alongside students from different disciplines.</li>
        <li>Showcased their unique web development projects, reflecting the skills gained throughout the course.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Post Summer Camp</h2>
    <p>Students who demonstrated exceptional competence in the summer camp will be recruited to teach new students
        class-based programming languages for the next semester. Students who wish to enhance their web development
        skills will also be guided by mentors (no classes will be provided for web development, except for some
        workshops).
